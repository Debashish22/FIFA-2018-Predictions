Modelling Steps:
1. After the variables impacting the result were selected, data for each of these variables were obtained from different sources
2. The data was obtained from the FIFA and espn site (sample link for 1 country from the espn site provided in the next site)
3. As the data here was at the player level, the result had to be aggregated  to the country level eg: adding the goals, shots, saves, fouls by each player to get the total for the team. 
4. To verify the correctness of the data, they were tallied from the FIFA site and in case of data not available in the ESPN site, it was searched for in the FIFA site
5. The training data for building the model was based on the past World cup records â€“2014, 2010, 2006, 2002. Details for the editions before these were  not available in these sites
6. The model created for Random Forest as it does in-sample testing which is helpful in case of samples with lesser records
7. The model was tested on the stats of the team for 1st 3 league stage games and the international friendlies held before the WC, as it provided the most recent trend
8. Based on the probabilities provided by the model and the draws of the next rounds, the winner and semi-finalists were predicted
